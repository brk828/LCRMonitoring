## Introduction

This summary analysis for MSCP Reach `r StudyReach` is auto-generated and results stated within should be considered preliminary.  These results are based on an analysis of stocking and scanning records.  PIT scanning records are restricted to  Fiscal Year (FY) `r FirstScanFY` through FY `r CurrentFY`.  Several approaches are used to assess the overall status of the population in the reach.  Known survival analysis provides a detailed fish by fish accounting of the fish that are known to be alive in the reach based on PIT scanning.  All fish must be at large for a minimum `r SurvivalDAL` days of PIT scanning regardless of tagging date.    

## Age Structure

The age structure of the PIT scanned population (134 kHz PIT tags) is based on post-release contacts of fish with a confirmed stocking record.  The age is determined...  Total length (TL) at release is simplified into two categories; less than `r SizeClass2` and greater than or equal to `r SizeClass2`.  Size at release for all stockings in the database by Release FY from `r CurrentFY-14` through `r CurrentFY-2` is provided in @fig-ReleaseSizePlot
